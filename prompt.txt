> Create a single mobile-friendly HTML file for an Eid greeting webpage. The design should be modern and clean. Here's what the page must include:

1. At the top of the page, display a .gif image (file name: eid.gif). It should be centered and fully responsive.


2. Below the image, show a festive greeting text like: "âœ¨ Eid Mubarak! May this Eid bring joy, peace, and prosperity to all! âœ¨" with beautiful styling (e.g., gradient text, glowing shadow, or animated fade-in).


3. Under the greeting, include a text input field where the user can type their name.


4. Below the input, show a stylish "Generate Eid Wish" button with animation and outline. On clicking, it should create a custom Eid greeting message using the entered name, like:
"Eid Mubarak from [Your Name]! ðŸŽ‰ Wishing you happiness and blessings!".


5. Below the greeting message, show a "Share on WhatsApp" button with WhatsApp icon and animation. On clicking, it should open WhatsApp share window with the message and a link to the current site (window.location.href).


6. As soon as the page loads, play the song.mp3 file (background music). Make sure the audio is set to autoplay and loop, with a volume control option or mute toggle.


7. The entire design should be optimized for mobile devices and look festive and clean. Use modern CSS (glassmorphism or neon theme welcome), animated buttons, and smooth transitions.


8. Everything (HTML, CSS, JS) should be written in one single .html file. Do not separate the files.


9. Include a <style> and <script> section inside the HTML. Also, include meta tags for responsive mobile view.


10. Ensure that the WhatsApp sharing works perfectly with mobile browsers when hosted on GitHub Pages.



I will upload two files to the same directory:

eid.gif â€” the image to be shown at the top

song.mp3 â€” the background audio


Use relative links like <img src="eid.gif"> and <audio src="song.mp3"> in the code.
